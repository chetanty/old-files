<font face ="Vladimir Script"><font color="red"><font size="80">Counter-Strike 
(officially abbreviated as CS) is a series of
 multiplayer first-person shooter video games, in 
which teams of terrorists and counter-terrorists battle 
to, respectively, perpetrate an act of terror (bombing, hostage-
taking) and prevent it (bomb defusal, hostage rescue). The series 
began on Windows in 1999 with the first version of Counter-Strike.
 It was initially released as a modification for Half-Life and 
designed by Minh "Gooseman" Le and Jess "Cliffe" Cliffe, before 
the rights to the game's intellectual property were 
acquired by Valve Corporation, the developers of Half-Life.</font></font></font>
